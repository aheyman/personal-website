## Technical Details

Built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), redux (limited), as well as Material-Ui and Visual Studio Code.

## Technical Discussion

Most of my React knowledge has been tied to connecting REST/Websocket requests to external services.
I enjoy publishing APIs and then fitting the results into a form so well designed components can provide a strong user experience.
This was my first attempt at designing an application from scratch.
As you can tell, I'm still learning, but I enjoy using React/Material-UI/Redux, so this was a fun project

### Static Site Generators

I was considering using Gatsby, which looks like a wonderful tool, to build this site.
I ultimately decided to build it from 'scratch' using CRA mostly for learning, as well as some basic familiarity.

## Running the Application

The remaining is just boilerplate CRA/NPM details (if anyone is so inclined to build/make a PR)

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
